I created this landing page to demonstrate work of JavaScript client side form validation.

Key features:

- Open/close and validate forms with JavaScript;
- Mobile first approach;
- Responsive design;
- Sliders;
- Hover effects and animations only if a device has a pointer;
- Tiny size of production build (only 683KB in total).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm i

# run project in development mode with browser sync on
$ gulp

# build for production (will create dist folder)
$ gulp build
```
